DESCRIPTION
       gcloud compute backend-services add-backend is used to add a backend to
       a backend service. A backend is a group of tasks that can handle
       requests sent to a backend service. Currently, the group of tasks can
       be one or more Google Compute Engine virtual machine instances grouped
       together using a resource view.

       Traffic is spread across the backends using waterfall-by-location. That
       is, a request is routed to the closest backend that has capacity. If
       the closest backend has reached its capacity, the second closest
       backend is chosen, and so on.

       To modify the parameters of a backend after it has been added to the
       backend service, use gcloud compute backend-services edit.

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
       NAME
           The name of the backend service.

FLAGS
       --balancing-mode BALANCING_MODE
           Defines the strategy for balancing load. "UTILIZATION" will rely on
           the CPU utilization of the tasks in the group when balancing load.
           When using "UTILIZATION", "--max-utilization" can be used to set a
           maximum, target CPU utilization for each task. "RATE" will spread
           load based on how many queries per second (QPS) the group can
           handle. There are two ways to specify max QPS: "--max-rate" which
           defines the max QPS for the whole group or "--max-rate-per-task"
           which defines the max QPS on a per-task basis.

           In "UTILIZATION", by default, the group may receive more requests
           than it can handle. To start dropping requests when the max
           utilization is reached, specify "--max-rate" or
           "--max-rate-per-task".

       --capacity-scaler CAPACITY_SCALER
           A float in the range [0.0, 1.0] that scales the maximum parameters
           for the group (e.g., max rate). A value of 0.0 will cause no
           requests to be sent to the group (i.e., it adds the group in a
           "drained" state). The default is 1.0.

       --description DESCRIPTION
           An optional, textual description for the backend.

       --format FORMAT
           Specify a format for printed output. By default, a command-specific
           human-friendly output format is used. Setting this flag to one of
           the available options will serialize the result of the command in
           the chosen format and print it to stdout. Supported formats are:
           "json", "text", "yaml".

       --group GROUP
           The name of a Google Cloud Resource View that can receive traffic.

       --help
           Display detailed help.

       --max-rate MAX_RATE
           Maximum queries per second (QPS) that the group can handle.

       --max-rate-per-instance MAX_RATE_PER_INSTANCE
           The maximum per-instance queries per second (QPS).

       --max-utilization MAX_UTILIZATION
           The target CPU utilization for the group as a float in the range
           [0.0, 1.0]. This flag can only be provided when the balancing mode
           is "UTILIZATION".

       --project PROJECT
           Google Cloud Platform project to use for this invocation.

       --quiet
           Disable all interactive prompts when running gcloud commands. If
           input is required, defaults will be used, or an error will be
           raised.

       --zone ZONE
           The zone of the resource view to add to the backend service. If not
           specified, you will be prompted to select a zone.

           To avoid prompting when this flag is omitted, you can set the
           "compute/zone" property:

               gcloud config set compute/zone ZONE

           A list of zones can fetched by running:

               gcloud compute zones list

           To unset the property, run:

               gcloud config unset compute/zone

           Alternatively, the zone can be stored in the environment variable
           "CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE".

       -h
           Print a summary help and exit.
